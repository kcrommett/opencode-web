## Session Performance & Persistence (Latest)

### Fixed Issues
1. **Duplicate agent fetches** - Removed redundant health check that called `getAgents()` multiple times
2. **Effect dependency loops** - Fixed React hooks with proper dependency arrays

All user preferences now persist across browser sessions using localStorage:
