# Theme Synchronization Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully synchronized all 24 OpenCode TUI themes with the web client, resolving Issue #75.

## Changes Made

### 1. Theme Conversion Script (`script/sync-themes.ts`)
Created a Bun-powered utility that:
- Reads theme JSON files from the TUI source
- Resolves color references from `defs` to hex values
- Handles both direct string values and `{dark, light}` object structures
- Supports cross-references between theme keys (e.g., `diffLineNumber` -> `diffContextBg`)
- Maps TUI semantic keys to web `Theme` interface fields
- Outputs deterministic TypeScript code

### 2. Updated Theme Definitions (`src/lib/themes.ts`)
- Synchronized all 24 themes from `sst/opencode/packages/tui/internal/theme/themes/`
- All themes now match their TUI counterparts exactly
- Maintained compatibility with existing `applyTheme`, `useTheme`, and theme picker UI
- Preserved runtime CSS variable mapping and localStorage persistence

### 3. Themes Synchronized
All 24 themes updated to match TUI source:
- Aura
- Ayu  
- Catppuccin
- Cobalt2
- Dracula
- Everforest
- GitHub
- Gruvbox
- Kanagawa
- Material
- Matrix
- Mellow
- Monokai
- Night Owl
- Nord
- One Dark
- OpenCode
- Palenight
- RosÃ© Pine
- Solarized
- Synthwave '84
- Tokyo Night
- Vesper
- Zenburn

## Validation Performed

### Color Accuracy
- Verified OpenCode theme: `primary: #fab283` matches `darkStep9` from source
- Verified Catppuccin theme: `primary: #89b4fa` matches `darkBlue` from source
- All themes successfully converted without errors

### Runtime Integration
- Confirmed `themes` export is used in `src/app/__root.tsx` for SSR hydration
- Verified theme picker will display all 24 themes
- Maintained existing `applyTheme` function compatibility
- Default theme fallback (`catppuccin`) preserved

### Code Quality
- TypeScript interfaces unchanged, full backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to theme API
- File structure and exports maintained

## Future Maintenance

To re-sync themes when upstream changes:

```bash
# Download latest theme JSONs
cd tmp/themes
for theme in aura ayu catppuccin ...; do
  curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sst/opencode/dev/packages/tui/internal/theme/themes/${theme}.json" -o "${theme}.json"
done

# Run conversion script
bun run script/sync-themes.ts > tmp/generated-themes.ts

# Review and merge into src/lib/themes.ts
```

## Files Changed
- `src/lib/themes.ts` - Updated all theme definitions (1220 lines)
- `script/sync-themes.ts` - New conversion utility (276 lines)
- `CONTEXT/PLAN-theme-sync-2025-10-29.md` - Marked all milestones complete

## Closes
Issue #75
