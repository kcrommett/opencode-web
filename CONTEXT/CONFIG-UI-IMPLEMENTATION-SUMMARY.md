# Config Integration UI Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-24  
**Status:** Phase 5 & 6 UI Integration Complete  
**Related:** PLAN-config-integration-2025-01-24.md

## Overview

This document summarizes the UI integration work completed for the OpenCode configuration system. The backend infrastructure was already in place - this work focused on connecting the UI components to use config data.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Agent Picker - Config Model Display ✅

**File:** `src/app/_components/ui/agent-picker.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `config` prop to AgentPicker component
- Imported `getAgentModel` helper from `@/lib/config`
- Enhanced agent display to show configured model for each agent
- Shows `Model: {providerID}/{modelID} (from config)` when a model is configured

**User Impact:**
- Users can now see which models are configured for each agent directly in the agent picker
- Clear "(from config)" indicator shows which models come from opencode.json

**Example:**
```
Agent: general
Description: General purpose coding assistant
Model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (from config)
```

### 2. Custom Commands Integration ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/commands.ts`
- `src/app/index.tsx`
- `src/app/_components/ui/command-picker.tsx` (used existing component)

**Changes:**

#### commands.ts
- Updated `Command` interface to include `"custom"` category and `custom?: boolean` flag
- Modified `getCommandSuggestions()` to accept `customCommands` parameter
- Modified `completeCommand()` to accept `customCommands` parameter
- Both functions now merge built-in and custom commands

#### index.tsx
- Added `config` and `commands` from `useOpenCodeContext()`
- Added `executeSlashCommand` from context
- Updated `handleInputChange()` to convert commands from context to Command format and pass to suggestions
- Updated Tab key handler to include custom commands in completion
- Updated `handleCommandSelect()` to handle custom commands with `command.custom` check
- Updated `handleCommand()` to check for `parsed.matchedCommand` and execute via `executeSlashCommand()`

**User Impact:**
- Custom commands from `opencode.json` or `command/**/*.md` files now appear in command picker
- Custom commands show with "custom" category
- Typing `/` shows all commands (built-in + custom)
- Tab completion works with custom commands
- Executing custom commands uses the configured agent, model, and prompt
- Custom commands are visually distinguished from built-in commands

**Example:**
```
# In opencode.json:
{
  "command": {
    "test": {
      "description": "Run tests with coverage",
      "agent": "build",
      "prompt": "Run the test suite and analyze coverage"
    }
  }
}

# In chat:
/test → shows in autocomplete with description
      → executes with build agent
      → uses configured prompt
```

### 3. Config Data Available Throughout App ✅

**File:** `src/app/index.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `config` and `commands` to destructured context values
- Config and commands now available for use across the component

**User Impact:**
- All config-aware features have access to latest config data
- Commands load automatically on app start
- No manual refresh needed

## Backend Infrastructure Already Complete ✅

The following backend work was already done (from earlier phases):

1. **Config Loading** - `useOpenCode` hook loads config on mount
2. **Command Loading** - Commands load from `/command` API endpoint
3. **Agent Model Resolution** - `getAgentModel()` helper resolves models from config
4. **Command Execution** - `executeSlashCommand()` function handles custom command execution
5. **Config Updates** - `useConfigUpdate` hook ready for saving config changes

## Remaining Work (Optional/Future)

The following items from the original plan are **not critical** but could be added in future:

### Task 2: Model Picker Config Indicators (Medium Priority)

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- Showing "(from config)" indicator next to default models in model picker
- Grouping models by "Configured" vs "Available"
- "Save as default for [agent]" button

**Why Deferred:**
- Model picker not in immediate use (agent picker shows config models)
- More complex UI changes required
- Lower user impact

### Task 3: Theme Save-to-Config (Low Priority)

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- "Save as default theme" checkbox in theme picker
- Integration with `useConfigUpdate` hook

**Why Deferred:**
- Theme persistence to localStorage already works
- Config update hook is ready if needed
- Lower priority than commands/agents

## Testing Performed

### Build & Type Safety ✅
```bash
bun x tsc --noEmit  # ✅ No errors
bun run build       # ✅ Success
bun run lint        # ✅ Only pre-existing test warnings
```

### Manual Testing Checklist ✅

- [x] Config loads on app start
- [x] Commands load from API
- [x] Agent picker shows configured models
- [x] Custom commands appear in command picker
- [x] Tab completion includes custom commands
- [x] Custom commands execute with correct agent/model
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Production build succeeds

## Files Changed

```
src/app/index.tsx                          - Added config/commands usage
src/app/_components/ui/agent-picker.tsx    - Show config models
src/lib/commands.ts                        - Support custom commands
```

## Architecture

```
opencode.json / command/**/*.md
        ↓
OpenCode Server (/config, /command APIs)
        ↓
useOpenCode Hook (loads config + commands)
        ↓
OpenCodeContext (provides to all components)
        ↓
UI Components (agent-picker, command-picker, etc.)
        ↓
Users see config-aware interface
```

## Key Features Working

1. ✅ **Agent-Specific Models from Config**
   - Agent picker shows configured model for each agent
   - Clear "(from config)" label
   - Uses `getAgentModel()` helper

2. ✅ **Custom Slash Commands**
   - Commands from config/markdown files load automatically
   - Appear in autocomplete when typing `/`
   - Execute with configured agent, model, and prompt
   - Tab completion works

3. ✅ **Seamless Integration**
   - Built-in and custom commands work together
   - No special UI needed - uses existing CommandPicker
   - Clear visual distinction (custom category)

## Developer Notes

### How to Add Custom Commands

**Via opencode.json:**
```json
{
  "command": {
    "mycommand": {
      "description": "My custom command",
      "agent": "general",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
      "prompt": "Do something specific..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Via Markdown Files:**
```markdown
<!-- command/mycommand.md -->
---
description: My custom command
agent: general
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

Do something specific...
```

### How Config Models Work

```typescript
import { getAgentModel } from "@/lib/config";

// In component:
const { config, agents, currentAgent } = useOpenCodeContext();

// Get configured model for current agent
const configModel = getAgentModel(config, currentAgent);
// Returns: { providerID: "anthropic", modelID: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" }

// This is automatically used by sendMessage() in useOpenCode hook
```

### How Custom Commands Execute

```typescript
// User types: /test some args
// System flow:
1. parseCommand("/test some args") 
   → matchedCommand found from commands array
   
2. executeSlashCommand(parsed, sessionId)
   → Resolves agent by name/id
   → Uses command.model or falls back to agent model
   → Builds prompt from command.prompt + args
   → Calls sendMessage()
   
3. Message sent with correct agent/model/prompt
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Config loads successfully on app start
- ✅ Agent models from config display correctly
- ✅ Custom commands execute with configured settings
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Production build succeeds
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Conclusion

The core config integration UI work is complete. Users can now:

1. See which models are configured for each agent
2. Use custom slash commands from their config
3. Benefit from config-driven defaults throughout the app

The remaining tasks (model picker indicators, theme save-to-config) are **optional enhancements** that can be added later if needed. The current implementation provides the most important user-facing features.

## Next Steps (Optional)

If further work is desired:

1. **Model Picker Enhancements** - Add config indicators and save-to-config buttons
2. **Theme Persistence** - Add "Save as default" to theme picker
3. **Config UI Panel** - Create dedicated settings view for editing config
4. **Documentation** - Update README with config integration details

All backend infrastructure is ready for these features if they are prioritized.
